# PricePredictionByUsingDecisionTree

A web project was made in python using the Django Framework.

PostgreSQL was used as a database.

When cleaning data, MATLAB, NumPy, and Pandas were used to make the data more suitable for the algorithm.

A decision tree was chosen as an algorithm by performing hyperparameter tuning with scikit-learn.
